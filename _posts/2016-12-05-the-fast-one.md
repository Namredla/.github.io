## About SmartPlug

In this project, we built a device, called the Smart Plug, which plugs into a standard wall outlet, and has an outlet to plug in an appliance. It allows a user to monitor the power use of the plugged-in appliance in a cost-effective way.

The Smart Plug has two major features.

 * It allows the user to view the real-time, and past power usage. An estimate of the cost to run the appliance is given along with the power usage.
 * It allows the user to turn the appliance on or off either immediately, or through a user-defined schedule. These features will be available to the user on any Android device.

In order to obtain power measurements, the Smart Plugâ€™s current transformer reads the current of the appliance and generates a small AC signal.
